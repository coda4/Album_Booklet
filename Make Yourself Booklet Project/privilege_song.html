    <h1>Privilege</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics</h2>

    <p>
        <i>Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy?<br/>
        Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore?<br/>
        Maybe it's me but this line isn't going anywhere<br/>
        Maybe if we looked hard enough, we could find a backdoor<br/>
        (Find yourself a backdoor)</i><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>I see you in line, dragging your feet<br/>
        You have my sympathy<br/>
        The day you were born, you were born free<br/>
        That is your privilege</i><br/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me<br/>
        Doesn't have a clue why he is waiting, or what he's waiting for?<br/>
        Maybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy<br/>
        Maybe if I look in my heart I could find a backdoor<br/>
        (Find yourself a backdoor)</i><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>I see you in line, dragging your feet<br/>
        You have my sympathy<br/>
        The day you were born, you were born free<br/>
        That is your privilege</i><br/>
