        <h1>Nice To Know You</h1>

            Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons<br/>
            Better than witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom<br/>
            She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings<br/>
            Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            I haven't felt the way I feel today<br/>
            In so long it's hard for me to specify<br/>
            I'm beginning to notice<br/>
            How much this feels like a waking limb<br/>
            Pins and needles, nice to know you<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go<br/>
            And higher than the heights of what we often think we know<br/>
            Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees<br/>
            To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            I haven't felt the way I feel today<br/>
            In so long it's hard for me to specify<br/>
            I'm beginning to notice<br/>
            How much this feels like a waking limb<br/>
            Pins and needles, nice to know you<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you<br/>
        </p>

        <p>Could it be that it has been there all along?</p>

        <p>
            I haven't felt the way I feel today<br/>
            In so long it's hard for me to specify<br/>

            How much this feels like a waking limb<br/>
            Pins and needles, nice to know you<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you<br/>
            Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you<br/>
